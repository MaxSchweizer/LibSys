# LibSys
CSC 517 Ruby on Rails LibSys Project

LibSys is a simple library inventory management application written with Ruby On Rails.

### Checkout History
Our implementation follows a hard-delete for a Library Member's history when an Admin removes a book from the system.  When a book is removed, a Library Member will no longer see any records related to the book in their checkout history.

##INFO
-Currently to show all books that are checked out, one should type in "true" in the search field and select status on the search button.
